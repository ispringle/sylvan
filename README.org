* Sylvan

** Synopsis

Sylvan is my site generator. It takes ~.org~ files and converts them into HTML
using NextJS. This is /not/ a static site generator and I have no intentions of
writing Sylvan in such a way that NextJS would be able to generate it
statically. I have used SSGs and I have static websites as well, but this is
different because I wanted to play with NextJS and create a beautiful website to
display my thoughts and notes. It is my goal to design and build Sylvan in such
a way that it meets /my/ needs. At the same time, I am fairly confident that
Syval /could/ work for you as a jumping off point for your own website. I would
suggest not just copying it and using it as-is, but mostly because I think it's
weird when people just copy someone else's personal site, becausae personal
websites are /personal/ and in some ways are an extension and reflection of the
person who created it.
