I really enjoyed this book. The setting is familiar enough -- England, or as the author refers to it Alba. The magic system in this book is also intersting and different enough to feel like it's not the same old tropes again. There are a LOT of characters though and the switching between them gets annoying once in a while, but generally it's not as bad as other reviews I have read make it out to be.

I would definitley recommend this book and I will definitely be reading the sequels once I get through Dreadgod!
