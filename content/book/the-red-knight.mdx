I really enjoyed this book. The setting is familiar enough -- England, or as
the author refers to it Alba. The magic system in this book is also intersting
and different enough to feel like it's not the same old tropes again. There are
a LOT of characters though and the switching between them gets annoying once in
a while, but generally it's not as bad as other reviews I have read make it out
to be.

One thing I am very interested in seeing is how the redemption arc of the main
character -- The Red Knight -- will play out through the series. Without
getting into more spoilers than needed, I think the author seems to be setting
him up for a coming-to-faith moment in a future book. Throughout the book you
see a character who blatantly curses God, but the level of derision and
loathing he expresses softens as his time among a convent of nuns goes on.

Regardless of how the redemption arc plays out, I really appreciate the level
of detail that the author put into the "feel" of this book's setting. The use
very specfic and archiac spellings of words really helps you feel like this is
a middle-age Europe. I'm also always intrigued by books that approach a
historical setting and seek to alter it in drastic ways and I like trying to
pick out the _actually_ historic elements behind the story. For example, there
is a not-to-distant "Empire" which is across the water from Alba. As best I can
tell this is either the Holy Roman Empire or the French empire, but right now I
can't be certain which.

Another interesting aspect I like is that the "bad" guys aren't so bad. And
it's not because they're "grey" but because the "good" guys are misinformed. I
appreciate that the author has taken some level of effort to show that the
religious elements in the book openly acknowledge that the "bad" guys aren't
all "bad", it makes reading the series a lot easier when there aren't
underlying digs like that.

All in all, I would definitley recommend this book and I will definitely be reading the
sequels once I get through Dreadgod!
