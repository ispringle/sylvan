# Howdy, I'm Ian.

![Me!](/about/me.jpg "It's me!")

I'm a sinner saved by grace. I am a husband and father. At work I wear a number
of tech related hates; site reliability engineer, systems engineer, software
developer, and systems architect. My wife and I also own a 125 acre homestead,
which means I am also a farmer, a rancher, a lumberjack, a mechanic, and a few
other things depending on what's broken at the moment.

I've sort of stumbled and tripped my way into the software world. I actually am
something of a Luddite, I really don't like modern technology all that much. I
drive old vehicles, I use old tractors, I don't own or have any desire to own a
television, the music we play comes from tapes and CDs, I prefer almost any
handtool to the mechanized alternative.

My interests are many and varied, and I hope this site can be some form of
outlet for all of them.
