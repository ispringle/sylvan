# Hello!

That's right, it's yet another blog from me. Another blog that, let's face it,
I won't probably use very much, and is really just an excuse to doing something
creative and learning a bit at the same time. Nonethesless, I am going to
create YAB and promise to update it.

My main motivations are:
 * Play with NextJS
 * Create a "digital garden" for my notes
 * In doing the above, hopefully eventually settle on platforms to use for day
   planning, notetaking, and writing

Unlike in prior blogs of mine (0x44.pw and bitranchlabs.com) I am going to try
to work on the development of this after my initial release. Meaning it's gonna
be **ugly** right now (and for a while)! I've also go to work on my neovim
config a bit, get my tmux-fu back up to speed, maybe get back to using
taskwarrior/timewarrior... so who knows, with so much stuff to do, maybe I'll
try writing about it some!
