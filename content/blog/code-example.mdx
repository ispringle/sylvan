This is just an example of some code blocks for testing rehype prism.

This is the time parser I use for Planwarrior. As you can see on lines 1-3 I have a time_str function which takes a string representation of time (`4:03`) and then determines how many minutes that is since midnight:
```python {1-3} showLineNumbers
def time_str(s):
    h, m = [int(x) for x in s.split(':')]
    return h * 60 + m


def plan(plan):
    return {
        time_str((y := x.strip().split(' '))[0]): ' '.join(y[1:])
        for x in plan.strip().splitlines()
    }
```
