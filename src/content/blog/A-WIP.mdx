As you can see this site is a serious WIP. But it's coming along, nonetheless
-- and dare I say it, is actually useable. Few tasks I'd like to get done next
include:

 - [ ] RSS feed(s)
 - [ ] Start rudimentary display of `/grok` -- aka the knowledge base
 - [ ] Programmigcally display projects under `/project` based on GitHub and
   GitLab starred projects
 - [ ] Add a section for my JS and love.js games so they can all be
   played/explored from this site
 - [ ] Better logo/branding/header thing and a favicon that isn't the NextJS
   default
 - [ ] Book review index as a gallery of book covers
 - [ ] Typography improvements including a better font, better colors, and
   automatically swap quotes and dashes for the appropriate curly quote or
   emdash, etc.

I'd also really love to figure out a way to incorporate Git commits into each post/review/etc. Basically figure out when the document was added in Git and that would stand in as my `date` and then figure out last modified date/time and add that as well. And speaking of time... the time values are wrong, I will need to investigate what is up with the `date-fns` library I'm using.
